---

**Defined:** 2026-01-15
**Core Value:** Automated discovery and correlation of network hosts to their switch ports — eliminating manual data gathering and reducing NetBox population from hours to minutes.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Discovery (5/5)

- [x] **DISC-01**: Tool can pull DHCP leases from MikroTik router via API
- [x] **DISC-02**: Tool can query Proxmox API for VM inventory (name, MAC, IP)
- [x] **DISC-03**: Tool can scan network subnets to discover hosts with static IPs
- [x] **DISC-04**: Tool can query MikroTik switch MAC tables to find host-to-port mappings
- [x] **DISC-05**: Tool correlates hosts across sources using MAC address as primary key

### Data Management (3/3)

- [x] **DATA-01**: Discovered hosts are stored in SQLite staging database
- [x] **DATA-02**: Duplicate hosts from different sources are merged by MAC
- [x] **DATA-03**: Each host has status tracking (pending/approved/rejected/pushed)

### Review (5/5)

- [x] **REVW-01**: Web UI displays all discovered hosts in a table
- [x] **REVW-02**: User can approve individual hosts for push
- [x] **REVW-03**: User can reject individual hosts (mark as ignored)
- [x] **REVW-04**: User can classify hosts (server/workstation/IoT/network)
- [x] **REVW-05**: User can bulk approve/reject multiple hosts at once

### NetBox Reconciliation (4/4)

- [x] **NBRC-01**: Tool can list existing devices from NetBox
- [x] **NBRC-02**: Tool compares discovered hosts with NetBox (highlights new)
- [x] **NBRC-03**: Tool detects stale NetBox entries (not seen in discovery)
- [x] **NBRC-04**: Tool can import NetBox devices into staging DB for reference

### Output (4/4)

- [x] **OUTP-01**: Tool creates NetBox devices/VMs for approved hosts with IP assignments
- [x] **OUTP-02**: Tool creates cable records in NetBox (switch port to device)
- [x] **OUTP-03**: Tool generates Unbound DNS config and pushes via SSH
- [x] **OUTP-04**: Tool supports dry-run mode (preview changes without pushing)

### CLI (4/4)

- [x] **CLI-01**: `discover` command runs all collectors and populates staging DB
- [x] **CLI-02**: `serve` command starts web UI server
- [x] **CLI-03**: `push` command pushes approved hosts to NetBox and Unbound
- [x] **CLI-04**: `status` command shows discovery/push status summary

### Configuration (3/3)

- [x] **CONF-01**: Tool reads credentials and settings from YAML config file
- [x] **CONF-02**: Secrets can be overridden via environment variables
- [x] **CONF-03**: Example config file is included with the project
